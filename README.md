## **Flask Application Design**

### **HTML Files**

**1. index.html:**
- Serves as the landing page, where users can upload a photo.
- Contains a form for photo upload and a button to submit the photo.

**2. recommendations.html:**
- Displays personalized makeup recommendations based on the uploaded photo.
- Includes sections for different makeup products, such as foundation, eyeshadow, lipstick, etc.
- Displays product information, including names, descriptions, and links to purchase.

### **Routes**

**1. /:**
- The route for the landing page, which renders the index.html file.

**2. /upload:**
- The route for handling photo uploads.
- Accepts a multipart/form-data request, parses the uploaded photo, and performs necessary preprocessing.
- Redirects to the /recommendations route to display the makeup recommendations.

**3. /recommendations:**
- The route for generating and displaying makeup recommendations.
- Receives the preprocessed photo from the /upload route.
- Calls a machine learning model or algorithm to analyze the photo and generate personalized makeup recommendations.
- Renders the recommendations.html file with the generated recommendations.

**4. /product-details/:product_id:**
- The route for displaying detailed information about a specific makeup product.
- Accepts a product ID parameter in the URL, which is used to fetch the product's information from a database or API.
- Renders a product details page with the fetched information.

### **Additional Considerations:**

- Implement proper error handling and input validation in the routes to ensure the application functions as expected even in the case of invalid inputs or unexpected errors.
- Use Flask's built-in session handling or a third-party session library to maintain user sessions across requests, if necessary.
- Consider incorporating a CSS file for styling the application's user interface.
- Include a favicon.ico file to customize the application's icon in the browser tab.
- Deploy the application to a production environment using a suitable hosting platform.
